# Learning-Reinforcement-Learning

This repo is for tracking my RL learning journey (at least at the beginning). For now, I am following dennybritz's RL repo (link: https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning).


- The first colab notebook is based on this tutorial: https://blog.paperspace.com/getting-started-with-openai-gym/
